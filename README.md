# Chess Bot

This is the github repository for the chess bot we will be making in the Harper Society of Engineers. Currently this is just a frame for what the repository will look like and I will be updating this more and more once I learn what we need to install and such.

The plan is for this to be coded in python but if that is not possible we can use a different language.

Might need YOLO from ultralytics for image recognision but idk.
